# Share-To-10C
A OS X Sharing Extension to easily post to your 10C account. This is currently a *beta*, so please forgive me any bugs and report them/create an issue.

Currently only supports log-in with your 10C account, but will support log-in via ADN later. 


Instructions
=============

Download the latest release, sign in with your 10C account and close the app. 
You can now use the OS X share extension after you've enabled it in `SysPrefs->Extensions->Share Menu`



Compiling from source
=====================

If you want to compile the app from source, you are free to do so. You will need a 10C AppKey for that. 
Ask [@matigo](https://github.com/matigo/), he might be feeling generous.
If you got one put it in `/Share-To-10C/Share-To-10C/AppDelegate.m`, compile and run the app. 
Afterwards you are free to remove it from the source again
